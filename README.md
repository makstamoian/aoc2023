# ðŸŽ„ Advent Of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

Brand new 2024 year is coming, and programmers all across the world spend their time solving this beautiful coding contest with Advent Calender elements. 

This repository contains solutions for problems I managed to solve. All solutions were written in Rust.

To run specific day solution (make sure it exists): 
```
cargo run --bin <dayN> --release
```

To run all available solutions:
```
chmod +x run-all.sh
./run-all.sh
```

Release option servers to provide higher performance (compared to dev building). For more info see: https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/build-configuration.html
